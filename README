## INFORMATION

This program simulates the popular Monty Hall game.

For information about the game, go to the wikipedia page: 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem

The program is much more an emulator than a simulator as it performs additional
steps which wouldn't be necessary for the purpose of gathering statistics.

The original Monty Hall game supports three doors.
This simulator supports an arbitrary number of doors, but not inferior to three.
